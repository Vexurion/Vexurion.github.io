## Alexx:
Worked in retail after highschool which challenged my critical thinking during stressful nights, teamwork when the workload was intense, and among a lot of other things, structure. I aspire to finish college to earn my CS degree and shift gears from a field of retail, to a field I'm most passionate about: Technology. I'm encouraged to be more, and to push for more, because of this bootcamp. Afterwards, I'd like to finish school, but that might change further down the line. Considering the doors that open because of this bootcamp, I might take up the opportunity to intern at companies I've only dreamt of working at. Fighting through my disposition, and to rise above my expectations to achieve things I never thought I could do in my life, bring me to a believe that anything is possible if you apply yourself. I'm excited to see where this opportunity takes me, seeing as this is my first step to a better life.
